### Project Description

WalkWithHer is a women-focused safety and support web application designed to help women feel safer and more confident while navigating public spaces. It provides quick-access safety features like SOS alerts, location sharing, and preventive tools along with emotional support through a calm and user-friendly interface.

### The Problem Statement

Women often face safety concerns while traveling alone, especially in unfamiliar or public spaces. Existing safety solutions are either too complex, reactive only during emergencies, or lack emotional reassurance, making them difficult to use when it matters most.

### The Solution

WalkWithHer addresses this problem by offering a simple, web-based safety companion that combines emergency response, preventive safety features, and emotional support. With one-tap SOS, live location sharing, virtual accompany mode, fake call simulation, and quick access to nearby help, the platform empowers women to feel safer, supported, and less alone.
