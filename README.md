### Project Description

WalkWithHer is a women-focused safety and support web application designed to help women feel safer and more confident while navigating public spaces. It provides quick-access safety features like SOS alerts, location sharing, and preventive tools along with emotional support through a calm and user-friendly interface.

### The Problem Statement

Women often face safety concerns while traveling alone, especially in unfamiliar or public spaces. Existing safety solutions are either too complex, reactive only during emergencies, or lack emotional reassurance, making them difficult to use when it matters most.

### The Solution

WalkWithHer addresses this problem by offering a simple, web-based safety companion that combines emergency response, preventive safety features, and emotional support. With one-tap SOS, live location sharing, virtual accompany mode, fake call simulation, and quick access to nearby help, the platform empowers women to feel safer, supported, and less alone.

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

*The system follows a client-side web architecture where the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User interactions (such as SOS, Fake Call, and Quick Help) are handled through JavaScript functions in the browser. The application uses browser APIs like Geolocation to fetch live location data and integrates with external services such as Google Maps and WhatsApp for navigation and emergency sharing. The app is deployed on Vercel, ensuring secure HTTPS access.*

**Application Workflow:**

*The workflow begins when the user opens the Walk With Her web application. From the home screen, the user can select features such as SOS, Accompany Mode, Quick Help, or Fake Call. When SOS is triggered, the app captures the user’s live location and prepares a shareable message via WhatsApp. Quick Help redirects users to nearby essential services using Google Maps. Fake Call simulates an incoming call to help users exit unsafe situations. All actions are handled in real-time within the browser without requiring backend servers.*
